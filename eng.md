Tarlab is a community in Oulu that brings together people interested in tech, computers, electronics, DIY and crafts. To support these goals, we have a lab in Tuira. We have common meetups regularly.

Our current location is the basement of [Valtatie 67](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=65.02556&amp;mlon=25.48520#map=18/65.02556/25.48520). Visitors can use the parking lots marked 'Offcode' in front of kindergarten next door.

As our doorbell was stolen, we use simple [knocking protocol](http://tarlab.fi/images/entry.jpg) for entry.

Space consists of one room with sofas, few desks, 3D printer (Prusa i3), soldering equipment, oscilloscopes, basic tools and wireless network. There's some refreshments available in fridge for small payment.

Tarlab is a [hackerspace](http://hackerspaces.org) (or hacklab). Hackerspaces can be found around the world and they share the similar ethos.
Organisation runnig the lab, Tarlab Oulu is a non-profit organisation and we don't have employees.
